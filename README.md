Setup
=====

Install `Play!` and make sure the `play` executable is in your `path`.

Put the competence, element and indication data files in `input/competence`.

Launch Darec by going into the root folder of the repository and executing `play run`.

Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:9000/bootstrap`. This will load the data in the in-memory database. You will need to do this everytime you restart the server.

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:9000/`...and there you go!
